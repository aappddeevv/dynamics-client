You can write a simple ETL program using the dynamics-client library. Some ETL supporting functions are available to assist you. With this, you write simple ETL programs that perform more advanced manipulation of your data while still keeping the final update/insert/delete step performant.

The ETL program you write can be sequenced with other CLI commands. Stitching together these parts creates a data migration/management solution.
