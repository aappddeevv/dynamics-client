The `webresources` command allows you to list, download and upload (one-time and watch) webresources. This method helps you incrementally develop your webresource based solution e.g. a UI written in javascript. You can also delete source maps in a solution that may be leftover from development iterations.

## Subcommands

* upload: Upload web resources. Optionally watch a directory to perform the upload. "Watch" both adds, updates and delete resources from your local disk depending on what happens to the file.
* delete: Delete a specific webresource by id. You can obtain the id from `list`.
* list: List web resources.
* delete-source-maps: Delete .js.map files from a specific solution's set of webresources.
