importdata allows you to importdata. Combined with other CLI programs such as csv-splitter.py and the program "parallel", you can easily create and execute parallel loads using the standard data import facility. This allows you to import a substantial amount of data quickly using the standard data import wizard design tools on the dynamics platform. Most importantly its free and you do not need to engage expensive ETL developers. If you are able to load data through a spreadsheet, you can use `importdata` to perform high-speed loading.
